      <h3><b>Overview of the Church</b></h3>
      <p>In the heart of Batangas City, Philippines, a fast growing church is making a difference in the lives of many people. Focusing on the mandate of Christ Jesus, they are reaching the lost, empowering the weak, healing the sick, setting the captives free, and sharing the love of God to those who are broken and had lost hope.</p>
      <br>
      They are making disciples and conquering the nations to fulfill the great commission, which Christ Jesus has given. Walking step by step, through God's grace, the church grew with impact and the rest was history.
      <br><br>
      This is a testimony of God's faithfulness in the 15 fruitful years of Jesus the Anointed One Church.
      <br><br>
      December 20, 1998 marks the humble birth of <span>Jesus the Anointed One Church</span>. On a Sunday afternoon, JA1 CHURCH, as it's famously known, rise in the service of reaching people for God.
      <br><br>
      It was an unexpected event.
      <br><br>
      Led by its founding pastor and president, Bishop Art Gonzales, the leadership of JA1 heeded God’s direction of spreading the fire of Inner Healing and Deliverance.
      <br><br>
      The start of the journey came not that easy. Skeptics, of course, predicted that the church would not stand against heavy persecution and would soon die. Others thought that the church would continue but would be smaller and far less effective.
      <br><br>
      Nobody knew from that day what lies ahead for the future of the birthed ministry but one thing is for sure. God had already planned the marvelous things that He will do to JA1.
      <br><br>
      Against all these odds, JA1 Church faithfully heeded the covenant-calling of the Lord and inched her way to fulfill the instruction she have received in Genesis 12:1-3 and Luke 4:18-19.
      <br><br>
      “The Lord has said to Abram, Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation and will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.
      <br><br>
      The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor, He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoner and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lords favor.”
      <br><br>
      Bishop Art Gonzales responded to the call of God and faithfully holds fast to what the LORD had instructed.
      <br><br>
      Then something big happened.
      <br><br>
      Through each service of JA1 CHURCH, God demonstrated powerful signs and wonders.
      <br><br>
      The outpouring of God's Spirit in each meeting was so thick that it resulted to amazing miracles that many had witnessed. It was a mighty outpouring that led people to experience deliverance and inner healing.
      <br><br>
      Sick people were healed. Demons possessed were set freed. And those who are in bondage were delivered through the power and name of Jesus Christ.
      <br><br>
      It was an astonishing sight. People witnessed the phenomenon in the Book of Acts as it was once more relived.
      <br><br>
      Through these divine manifestations of God's presence, the Church grew in leaps and bounds. Evangelism, church growth, and church planting came to a great number. People from different walks of life surrendered their lives to God, made and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal LORD and Savior and experienced the liberating power of the Holy Spirit.
      <br><br>
      In the Philippines, outreaches and daughter churches were founded stretching from the big islands of Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. JA1 became a strategic-territorial church that claimed the land for Christ and saturated it with the Gospel.
      <br><br>
      But this was only the beginning of something bigger.
      <br><br>
      Inner Healing and Deliverance Crusades and Conferences were held in different parts of the country. Mission Caravans were also established in every town, province and city. There was a great awakening. Hundreds of people encountered the mighty power of Christ. There were miracle healings, divine restorations and deliverances that proved once again that God is far more than able to the impossible.
      <br><br>
      Indeed, no one can stop the flowing of God’s manifested power. It was so intense that even different Evangelical and Full gospel churches were imparted with this fire through JA1 CHURCH.
      <br><br>
      As a result, churches were established in different parts of the globe, stretching from South East Asia, the East Asia, the Middle East, Europe, North America and Central America.
      <br><br>
      By the mighty grace of God, there are one hundred sixty JA1 churches across the globe, bridging cross cultural missions and reaching different nationalities for Christ Jesus.
      <br><br>
      Indeed, there is more to come for JA1 church and that season is now.
